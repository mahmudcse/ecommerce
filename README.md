The project was developed commercially for a client and is on live now on https://www.siliconbasket.com/. It was the biggest project I developed myself from scratch.

# What it does: It works as a super shop
  1. Any brand can sell their product here.
  2. Any customer can buy from here.
  3. Registered or guest user both have buying access.
 Moreover almost every feature is there an ecommerce site should have.
